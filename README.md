# Handeye-ATA

This repository contains a code described in the paper "Adjoint Transformation Algorithm for Handâ€“Eye Calibration with
Applications in Robotic Assisted Surgery". The main hand-eye calibration script is stored in HandEye_ST.m. The script takes the relative motion of the camera and the robot as input.
